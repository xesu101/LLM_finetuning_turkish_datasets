# LLM Fine-Tuning Turkish Datasets

This repository contains datasets specifically prepared for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) in Turkish. The datasets are structured in the Alpaca format and focus on topics such as cryptocurrency markets, investment strategies, technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and market psychology.

## Contents

- **Datasets:** Turkish financial and investment datasets in Alpaca format.
- **Examples:** Sample datasets for fine-tuning and their descriptions.
- **Documentation:** Information on how datasets are created, their format, and usage.

## Usage

1. **Download dependencies:**
   - Install the necessary dependencies from `requirements.txt` (to be updated later).

2. **Explore the datasets:**
   - You can find datasets in the `datasets/` folder.

3. **Fine-Tuning:**
   - The datasets are compatible with Hugging Face's `transformers` and `peft` libraries.

## Alpaca Format

The datasets are currently in JSON format, but Parquet versions will be added for easier integration with Hugging Face.
